            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At laſt I was convinced into a change of my opinion; and my grounds of ſo doing, I firſt (upon his requeſt) communicated to a Reverend Miniſter, now with the Lord, only in a Letter; himſelf and ſome other godly Brethren deſired me, a little more fully to ſet down in Writing what I had to ſay for it: I did gratifie them in part, ſo that one ſheet of Paper ſwelled into five. And having communicated the ſame ſheets to ſome other pious and godly Brethren, they cold me they would have it printed: This, I confeſs, was beyond all my intentions; but I durſt not altogether reject their Requeſts, only conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we live in a touchy Age, I deſired that I might write it over a third time, that ſo if

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93986:7"/>and ſerious ſtudies to be underſtood, the book unſealed, the Viſion made known, and if ſo, then this our practice is juſtifiable, and the practice of all thoſe holy, godly, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divines, who have ingaged themſelves in ſtudies of this nature, laudable, and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. And although many learned pens have been miſtaken in ſome things, yet they have hit right in many others; if ſome lines have been crooked, yet many have been ſtraight; men have not been infallible, and yet for all that, very profitable, ſo that by their canvaſing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to and fro, knowledge hath increaſed. But on the other hand the careleſneſs and remiſneſs, and negligence of the world, not looking nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, diligently, and ſeriouſly into Myſteries, and Prophecies, hath done a great deal of hurt. What elſe (I pray you) was the cauſe, that when Chriſt, in his firſt coming was ſo earneſtly expected, and looked for, and deſired, and all this about the time when he did come, yet he came, and came to his own, and to his own that expected him, and did his work, and went again, and they did not receive or own him? Again, what elſe was the cauſe, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be looked for, and ſeared, that he would come, and this about the time that he did come; and was written &amp; preached againſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93986:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Yet he came, and came at that very time, and yet found entertainment; yea, hath almoſt lived his long life, done his work, and run his thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes or years; and yet for all this, the more part will hardly take notice of it? but take him for Chriſts Vicar, whom the Dragon ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and made to be his own Lieutenant. Again, is not Chriſt almoſt ready to take the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, and caſt both out of the World into the Lake: and take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his great power and reign, and give the Kingdom to the Saints, and reduce the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under his dominion, and binde up Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and ſit on the throne of <hi>David;</hi> and yet the more part will beleeve none of all this.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93986:8"/>from Chriſt unto the conſummation of all things; which times are the laſt, in reſpect of the times of the world complexively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as old age is the laſt times of a man in reſpect of his whole complex age. Now theſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or laſt times, conſiſt of three great periods; as <hi>Meàe,</hi> the ſober Gueſs, and others, have abundantly cleared and made out; the firſt of theſe was the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or time of the Dragon, when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm raged in the world; the ſecond was the time of the Beaſt and falſe prophet, who ſynchronize, when ſuperſtition and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries prevail; the third is the <hi>Millennium</hi> or Reign of Chriſt, when Satan is bound up. and the Kingdom given to the Saints. Note we further, that the Scripture tells us of no other period, theſe three are all, and where the firſt end, the ſecond begins; and the ending of the ſecond juſt precedes the beginning of the third. Now our queſtion is of the ſecond of theſe three periods. And in the firſt place, for the <hi>Riſe of Antichriſt,</hi> or the beginning of the ſecond period; or of the thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes, or the fourty and two months. It is the opinion of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending of them muſt be taken in

"A man may (not without ground) imagine, that there may be a Latitude of reckoning in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the three times and a half, or the fourty two months into 126 Decads of days, as well as there is of thoſe times and months, and that any variation about or within, that exceeds not a Decad, breaks no ſquare.

Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his <hi>Diatriba,</hi> in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> diſcourſing of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 42 months, hath this paſſage, "The period of the 42 months, (ſaith he) is likely and moſt probably to be taken from ſome remarkable moment in the latitude of their beginning, which remarkable moments (ſaith he) are more then one, and ſhall be

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93986:12"/>in whoſe power it is to confer and transfer Kingdoms, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. And <hi>John</hi> in this place ſpeaks plainly of power received: they received power as Kings one houre with the Beaſt; which who doth not ſee, though but with half an eye, to be here referred to the time of their Reignings and Kingdoms firſt taken. Concerning a matter not unlike <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libius,</hi> a moſt grave and ſober Writer, being to give his judgment concerning the Riſe of the Romane Empire, he compares it with the beginning of the Macedonian, and ſpeaks thus to us, <hi>Ego principio cujuſque rei eſſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo, primus conatus, &amp;c.</hi> I conclude (ſaith he,) that the beginnings of any thing are the firſt endeavours. &amp;c. But to let paſs <hi>Polybius,</hi> I do ſuppoſe, at that time thoſe ten Kings received their power, when the Pope did not only take to himſelf the Primacie, and exerciſe it: but did with his idolatrous Clergie, go about to paganize the Empire, by his new idolatries and ſuperſtitions. For the holy Propheſie affirmes that they roſe at one and the ſame hour: They received power as Kings one houre with the Beaſt. The Kings receive power, and are actually crowned Kings at the ſame time of this Beaſt, under the ſucceſſion of the laſt Head, getting again
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93986:12"/>into being, and therefore this healed Beaſt his ten Hornes are repreſented with ten Crowns upon them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers exactly to this preſent text, <hi>they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved power as Kings one houre with the Beaſt.</hi> The ſenſe <hi>I</hi> gueſs is this, that at what time the Beaſt ſhould revive and be worſhipped, that is, obeyed and yielded to, or in plain Engliſh, about what time the Empire ſhould re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apſe again into idolatry, and be re-aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ancient pagan-rites, though placing them upon Chriſtian-objects, about that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time the Empire ſhould be rending into ten Kingdoms: or theſe ten Kings ſhould be receiving power as Kings, all of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing or ſucceeding in their Enterpriſes, within a little time, from the firſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Empire into pagan-idolatries and ſuperſtitions. Therefore not of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Kingdoms of this ten-horned Beaſt, but of his youth and Infant-ſtate when thoſe Kings firſt challenged a right to the Roman throne, the ſacred Propheſie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12. is to be underſtood. Hence I conclude, the Character of the riſing of the Beaſt or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, which is all one, is to be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 410. For it is evident from what was ſpoken before, that the Beaſt was

               </list>
               <p>That the Kingdom in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that of a thouſand years in the Apocalypſe, are one and the ſame Kingdom, plainly and evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears thus:</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93986:18"/>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe they began <hi>ab eodim termino,</hi> from the ſame <hi>Epocha</hi> or beginning, namely, at the deſtruction of the fourth Beaſt; That in <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the Beaſt (then ruling in the wicked horn) was ſlain, and his body deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and given to the burning flame, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.11, 22, 27.

               <p>Secondly, becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> begins the <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or Kingdom, of a thouſand years, from the ſame Seſſion of Judgment deſcribed in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as appears by his parallel expreſſion borrowed from thence;</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>ch.</hi> 20. Ver. 4. <hi>I ſaw thrones, and they ſate upon them.</hi>

                  <hi>And the Saints lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi>

                  <hi>And the Saints poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Kingdom</hi> viz. <hi>with the Son of man who came in the clouds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be ſufficiently proved that the one thouſand years begin with the Day of Judgment, it will appear further out of the Apocalypſe, that the Judgment is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate till they be ended; for <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magogs</hi> deſtruction, and the univerſal reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is not till then: Therefore the whole one thouſand years is included in that great Day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>But thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken by way of Explication, to that Mother Text in the Old Teſtament, the which I have ſo called, becauſe hence it will follow, <hi>quaſi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectarium quoddam de interpretatione aliorum Scripturae locorum huc pertinentium,</hi> that whatſoever Scripture ſpeaks of a Kingdom of Chriſt to be at his ſecond appearing, or at the deſtruction of Antichriſt, muſt needs be the ſame which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw ſhould be at that time, and ſo conſequently be the Kingdom of a thouſand years, which the Apocalypſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes between the beginning and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93986:19"/>of the Great Judgment. All of them alſo have a likeneſſe, and are referred to this.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Daniel</hi> (ſay ſome, who with Dr. <hi>Willes</hi> and others, take this wicked horn to be meant of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>) ſhews not the Roman Monarchies perſecution of the Church; and the fall of the ſame Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. For,

               <p>The former part of the Antecedent is granted by all Interpreters of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe. The latter part is clear in the Text, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.3.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Monarchie was the Aſſyrian, which fell into the Babylonian, and bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Nimrod, Gen.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10 and was ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that preſent <hi>Nebuchadnizzar,</hi> his Child and Grandchild. This Monarchy was repreſented in that Image, by the Head of Gold, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.38.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Monarchie was that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which bloſſomed in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who conquered <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſlew <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,</hi> and endured till <hi>Darius,</hi> whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> a Grecian overthrew. This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie was expreſt in that Image, by the Breaſts and Armes of Silver, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.39. <hi>with ver.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Monarchie was that of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93986:22"/>Greeks which bloſſomed, or rather imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely and ſuddenly ripened in <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great of <hi>Mecedon,</hi> who preſently by his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over run the World; and by his ſudden and untimely death, was divided into four great parts, by four of his Chief Generals, who parted the World among them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.39. This Grecian Monarchie was expieſt, in that Image by a belly and thighs of braſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Monarchie was that of the Romans, which bloſſomed and ripened lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely, and by degrees; and was therefore more likely to laſt long. And by certain gradations and much time rooted out ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively all the inheritors of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and the Upholders of the Greek Monarchie, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt all the Chief known parts of the World, and ſo fetching its beginning lower Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and yet up as high Eaſtward, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mightier Monarchie then any of the former. This Monarchie was expreſſed in the Image by the legs of Iron. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32, 40. becauſe as Iron, it was ſtrongeſt of all and ſubdued all under it, but in proceſſe of time. the Body of the World, which it bore up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great, to which it was a leg or ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it divided it ſelf, (as it is in the natural body) into two legs, and is in the Image ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93986:23"/>expreſſed, (though for a great while it was but one Monarchy) yet at laſt it grew into two, the Eaſtern and Weſtern Monarchy. the Weſtern, after the Eaſtern was loſt, fell into feet and toes, or Kingdoms, wherein was both ſtrength and weakneſſe, iron and clay, and theſe never to be rejoyned or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, notwithſtanding it hath bin endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Marriages and other Covenants, to mingle and to rejoyne in one Monarchy. But it ſhall never be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to the period and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of their Soveraignty and Monarchy, they ſhall remain Kingdoms diſtinct, as feet and toes of iron and clay unminglable.</p>

And whereas the other Monarchies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93986:23"/>were erected by men on earth, (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God) this Kingdom or Monarchy ſhall ſwallow up in it all foregoing Monarchies, and that by no humane means or policy, for it was without hands, or not in hand: that is, not of man, but a divine work every way; and it ſhall reach and ſwallow up, not only the feet and toes, but the legs of braſs, the breaſt and armes of ſilver, the head of gold, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34, 35. that is, all Kingdoms and States, that were from firſt to laſt under any of the Monarchies ſhall be ſwallowed up by, and come under this.

               <p>¶ The next text we may look into, and as it were the eldeſt daughter of theſe already hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is that 20th. chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak a little more largely, wrapping in many other Scriptures, handling the fame thing with it; Where firſt we have <hi>ver.</hi> 1. the Lord Jeſus Chriſt deſcending and coming down from Heaven, in thoſe words, <hi>I ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand:</hi> This Angel is Chriſt called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chail,</hi> Rev. 12.7. who deſtroys the works of the Devil, and is ſtronger then he, to bind him and caſt him out of the aire into the pit. It is he that conquered him upon his white Horſe, who went forth. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ut vince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>) that he might conquer He caſt him down to the earth; <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8. He defeated him in his Lieutenant the Eeaſt. He hath the Keyes of Hell and Death, and his regal power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is norably ſet out by the Emblem of a great chain in his hand. And here he doth three things unto him.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93986:24"/>
               <p n="1">1. He apprehends him, he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan. He layes hold upon him by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and gripes him as one in fury. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Dragon here, and <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 9. is one and the ſame, to ſhew that it is the ſame Devil, that there was caſt into the earth, and now by this deſcending Angel the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is caſt into the pit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He binds him, the term of his bondage being expreſſed, and bound him, he ties him up from his former liberty, and chains him as men do deſperate dogs or maſtiffs, and that for a long time. And bound him a thouſand years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Impriſons him, the place where is in the bottomleſs pit, that is, an Abyſs, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feared, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31. <hi>they beſought him that he would not command them to go</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>into the deep, or pit;</hi> as it is here the original word is one and the ſame. And the Manner how was very ſecurely, he ſhut him up, and ſet a Seal upon him; As ſometimes it was with <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.17. And with Chriſts body in the Sepulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>ult.</hi> which ſhews the certainty and fulneſſe of this reſtraint, and the compleat power and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Angel over him, who ſhall no more ſuffer Satan this thouſand years to range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to diſturb the Reign of Chriſt and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93986:25"/>his people, and to do miſchief as before, being faſt ſhut and locked up in priſon; he ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe his former violence nor ſubtilties. Laſtly, the end of all this is, that he ſhould deceive the Nations no more; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is not to be underſtood abſolutely and ſimply, (as if he ſhould not have any liberty to deceive any man living, as ſome would have it) but with reſpect to ſuch extent and ſucceſſe as before, he ſhall not now proſper in his deſignes and attempts. And it ſignifies a new and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſtraint, beyond that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. where he was caſt down to the earth. when he was caſt down from open heatheniſm, and open per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution as a Dragon, under that notion he was caſt out of the Church: yet he did begin preſently to try a new way, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs; For as before he had made the world mad in their heatheniſm, ſo now he makes them mad in idolatries and ſuperſtitions, ſubſtituting the Beaſt in his room and place, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him his power, and ſeat, and great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. And cauſing that all both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bound, ſhould receive a mark in their hands or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, elſe they ſhould not have the liberty to buy or ſell, pray or preach, traffick or trade with any.</p>
               <p>But now he ſhall be bound from that liberty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93986:25"/>of deluding the Nations any more, either by his Paganiſme, as he did in the firſt period, or by ſuperſtition and idolatry, as in the ſecond. Neither yet ſhall he tempt them any more, ſo as to diſquiet and trouble their peaceful reign with Chriſt on earth.</p>
               <p>But to go on, this preparation being made, we reade <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi>) <hi>Thrones, and they ſate upon them, and Judgment was given unto them, and I ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither his Image, neither had received his mark, upon their foreheads, or in their hands: and THEY lived and REIGNED with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi> In which words, that we may come as near their ſenſe and meaning as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can, I ſhall endeavor to explain and make clear theſe three things following, <hi>viz.</hi>

The Argument may be thus framed.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93986:30"/>

               <p>But the firſt Reſurrection is the Reſurrection of the dead in bodys, for it is the Reſurrection of thoſe that were beheaded; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is of the body—.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Text ſpeaks of ſuch a Reſurrection, wherein men live a thouſand years after they be raiſed, which cannot agree to any other life or reſurrection, but the life and reſurrection of the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>John</hi> was not called upon from Heaven to behold that which he and every Chriſtian new before, or to have Tautologies told him. For if by reſurrection ſhould be meant regeneration, (as ſom would have it) he knew, and ſo did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian before, that ſuch were bleſſed.

               <p n="3">3. He that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, ſhall live and reign with Chriſt a thouſand years, but no regenerate man did ever live ſo long in a ſtate of regeneration; <hi>Ergo,</hi> rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration cannot be meant by this reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="4">4 No man is regenerate after death, but the men that were beheaded, did live and reign with Chriſt a thouſand years, after they were beheaded; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this life and reign cannot be meant of regeneration.</p>

               <p>Beſides, that this Kingdom, and the Saints reign ſhall be on Earth, may be gathered from two things in the Text, which offer themſelves to leave this beyond all doubt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Devil ſhall be perfectly bound
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93986:33"/>up, in the bottomleſs-pit, that the Saints may quietly reign, which would not be needful to be done, that the Saints might quietly reign in Heaven, for he could make no diſturbance there, nor get thither.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe unleſs they were to reign on Earth, Satan, <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> could not war againſt them. But we read, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.8. <hi>That when the thouſand years are ended,</hi> God. <hi>and</hi> Magog <hi>ſhall riſe againſt them:</hi> From whence it doth appear, that the beloved City and the Camp of the Saints, ſhall be in the midſt of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> in the four quarters of the Earth. For it is ſaid: <hi>They ſhall compaſs the beloved City and the Camp of the Saints about,</hi> which they could not do, if either of them were in Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Kingdom is to come upon Earth; yet it ſhall not be an Earthly or a worldly Kingdom, as the <hi>Chilliaſtes,</hi> and ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> vainly dreamed and imagined: but a gloriouſly ſpiritual and holy Kingdom. Chriſts Kingdom now is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual Kingdom in the hearts of his people: But then it ſhall be ſo, and much more holy and ſpiritual, as well as more glorious, then ever it was before, when the Kingdoms of the World ſhall become the Kingdoms of God and of his Chriſt. When the Lord himſelf ſhall be King over all the Earth, and his Name be one.</p>

                  </label> For anſwer to this; I cannot ſee at all how ſuch a ſucceſſion, or ſuch ſucceſſors ſhould be meant here by this firſt reſurrection, and this reign with Chriſt a thouſand years, and that for theſe reaſons (amongſt others) follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="5">5. When the text ſaith THEY lived and reigned with Chriſt a THOUSAND years; let the reader be pleaſed diligently to weigh theſe two things following.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If living a thouſand years be meant of living in ſucceſſors, then by this reckoning before the thouſand years began the Saints had no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93986:35"/>and after the thouſand years are ended, they ſhall have no ſucceſſors neither. As ſuppoſe the thouſand years ſhould begin (<hi>ut aliqui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt,</hi> as ſom would have it) in the days of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great, which was about three hundred years after Chriſt, then the Saints which lived and died before his days, had by this reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no ſucceſſors, for the thouſand years of living in ſucceſſors was not before then begun: And all the Saints who have lived and died ſince bleſſed <hi>Luthers</hi> time, have had no ſucceſſors, for according to this account, the thouſand years of living in ſucceſſors, was ended before he did begin. What a ſtrange Prophecy have ſome made this for the Angel to tell <hi>John</hi> of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years in which the Saints ſhall live in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, whereas the Saints have had ſucceſſors for above 1660 years already, ſince Chriſts time, and how many years more they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſucceed each other, who can tell, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the holy Prophecy muſt have ſome other meaning then of ſucceſſors.</item>
                  <item>2. If by the reigning of the ſouls of them that were beheaded, be meant reigning in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, then by this reckoning there is no reigning of the Saints at all. For if there be, it is either before or after death, before death it cannot be, for that is a time of ſuffering, not of reigning: And after death they reign not in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93986:36"/>their ſucceſſors; for their ſucceſſors are in the ſame ſtate of ſuffering that their predeceſſors were, not of reigning; for inſtance, take we <hi>A,B,C,D, A</hi> doth not reign in his ſucceſſor <hi>B,</hi> becauſe <hi>B</hi> doth not reign himſelf, if he do, it is either before death or after death; but <hi>B</hi> doth not reign before death, for that is a time of ſuffering, not of reigning; and after death he doth not reign in his ſucceſſor <hi>C,</hi> for <hi>C</hi> is in the ſame ſtate of ſuffering that his Predeceſſor <hi>B</hi> was, and not of reigning, and the ſelf-ſame is the caſe of <hi>D,</hi> &amp;c. But happily you will ſay that <hi>A</hi> did reign in his life-time a part of the thouſand years, and <hi>B</hi> did reign in his life-time another part of the thouſand years, after <hi>A</hi> was dead, and <hi>C</hi> did reign another part after <hi>B</hi> was dead, and ſo of <hi>D, &amp;c.</hi> But this evaſion is nothing to the purpoſe, for this kind of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (if the time of our ſuffering might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the time of our reigning) is more then a thouſand years, yea, ſeveral thouſand years; but the reigning <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, is juſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and neither more nor leſſe. But to ſpeak the truth, there is no ſuch kind of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this evaſion ſpeaks of: for <hi>A</hi> did not reign in his life-time, for that was (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) a time of ſuffering, not of reigning; the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>B, C,</hi> and <hi>D:</hi> And therefore <hi>A</hi> not reigning in his own perſon while he lived,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93986:36"/>nor in his ſucceſſor <hi>B,</hi> nor <hi>B</hi> in his ſucceſſor <hi>C,</hi> &amp;c. reigns not at all, becauſe they reign not after <hi>A</hi> is dead. Again, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, if we ſuffer we do reign, as if ſuffering and reigning went together, but <hi>we SHALL reign,</hi> that is after death, not before. So <hi>John</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>Soules,</hi> i.e. dead men that lived and reigned with Chriſt, not in ſucceſſors, who themſelves were ſufferers while they lived, and not reigners but in their own perſons.</item>

But it ſeems to me, that a ſpiritual, without a perſonal, ſhould not be here meant. For
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>David</hi> had no ſuch reign himſelf, nor <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his ſon, nor any of his ſeed. Yet we reade that <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon did ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David</hi> his father, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.12.24. And what man will ſay; that by Throne is meant, the ſpiritual reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> without a perſonal. And if it be not to meant when it is ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> why ſhould any think it to be ſo meant when it is ſpoken of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſpiritual reign of Chriſt belongs to him as he is God, but to ſit on the Throne of <hi>David</hi> belongs to him as man, As <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93986:42"/>Therefore <hi>David</hi> being a Prophet, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God had ſworn with an Oath to him, that of the fruit of his loynes according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne, &amp;c. The Throne of <hi>David</hi> is one thing, and his ſpiritual reign another.</item>
                     <item>3. When Chriſt is called the Son of <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.42. no man will ſay, that thereby is meant the Son of God: No more ought any man to think, that when Chriſt is ſaid to ſit on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> that thereby is meant the ſpiritual Throne of God. For doubtleſſe they are two diſtinct things.</item>
                     <item>4. Chriſt did reign ſpiritually, and that in the heart of <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf, before this Propheſie was revealed to her: But Chriſt did not at that time ſit on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel told her, he ſhould ſit on the Throne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hereafter. And therefore this ſpiritual reign is one thing, and the Throne of <hi>David</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                     <item>5. The ſpiritual reign of Chriſt is in reference to ſpirituals; But his ſitting on the Throne of <hi>David</hi> is to order it with judgement and juſtice, <hi>Iſa</hi> 9 7. <hi>Of the increaſe of his Government and Peace there ſhall be no end; upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to ſtabliſh it with judgment, and with juſtice, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, even for ever.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Behold the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93986:42"/>dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute judgement and juſtice in the Earth.</hi> This ſeems to imply ſom other thing and matter.</item>
                     <item>6. The Throne of <hi>David</hi> is peculiar to Chriſt alone, and not common to all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: But the ſpiritual reign of Chriſt in the hearts of men is common to all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not peculiar to Chriſt alone.

               <p>¶ <hi>Peter</hi> alſo (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.) ſpeaks (if I be not deceived) clearly to this. <hi>Behold, the day of the Lord cometh:</hi> How? <hi>As a Thief in the night,</hi> i. e. ſuddenly: yet ſhall not as a Thief diſappear the very ſame night. <hi>In that day the Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, and the Elements melt, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhall not be done <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and at once, as is manifeſt in the words, diſſolved, melt, burnt up, which require an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time for their accompliſhment.

Nor becauſe his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is joyned with the final Reſurrection, and laſt Judgment properly and ſtrictly ſo called:

               <p n="7">7. Becauſe to interpret the firſt Reſurrection, of a piritual reſurrection from ſin, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new and unheard of, and unknown to all Orthodox Antiquity, and that almoſt till <hi>Auſtins</hi> time: And was firſt of all found out by <hi>Tyconius</hi> the Donatiſt, of whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it; whom afterward <hi>Primaſius</hi> followed, <hi>Gregory,</hi> and others. Yea, they that deny this Interpretation, deny that which was of old denied by the Hereticks againſt the Orthodox, as it doth plainly appear from <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew: which Dialogue is ſet down at large by Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> at the latter end of his Commentary upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> whither I refer the Reader. But to clear the thing beyond doubt, Conſider, that though the death in ſin may be called a death; yet it is not, nor any wherein Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the death, either firſt or ſecond: if that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93986:53"/>death in ſin be the death, then it is the firſt death, and the Life of Grace the firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and then all, that have a part in this, ſhould be freed from the ſecond death, which ſecond death by this reckoning muſt be the death of the body, but that we ſee is falſe, for the godly die the death of the body as well as the wicked. Therefore let us give way to the plain truth, which is in a word thus. The firſt death is the death of the body, or a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death: the ſecond death is the death of the ſoul, or the ſoules everlaſting puniſhment in Hell: And the firſt Reſurrection, or the firſt order in the Reſurrection, (for I ſpeak not here of Chriſt, and thoſe that aroſe then) is the Reſurrection of the body, or a bodily Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Saints, and they that have part in this are none but ſuch as are holy, and by this their being within the Compaſs of the firſt order in the Reſurrection, or being raiſed in the firſt Reſurrection, they are beyond all fear of condemnation in hell which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death: Therefore the Text ſays, <hi>Bleſsed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power:</hi> which Reſurrection (as we ſee) cannot be meant of the life of grace, but muſt be meant of that corporal Reſurrection, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a bodily death, or the death of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93986:53"/>body, and not to the death in ſin.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Becauſe although Chriſts Oeconomical or Mediatory Kingdom is but one, in regard of its eſſential forme: yet it is indeed twofold in reſpect of its accidental forme.

For then there will be a very great and unparallelable converſion; but yet in another ſtate) to walk in the light thereof, and take their directions thence: Will he thus make all things new, and cauſe things old to paſs away? had the Saints an eye to look through all thoſe ſad and ſharp calamities, of a thouſand and ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years continuance, unto this time? as they do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. did all the Prophets ſo eſee, and ſpeak of theſe glorious times and things? did the Apoſtles make ſo many queries, and Chriſt ſo many promiſes referring to this time and ſtate?

But if we ſpeak of the laſt day in ſpecial, it may have another day, or another year to follow after it, acoording as the day or year is that we ſpeak of: As ſuppoſe we ſpeak of the laſt day of this world; it hath a day, and a year, and another word to ſucceed it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. <hi>The world to come, Eph.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5.

But if we ſpeak of the laſt day of the next world, it is the ultimate day of all, or the laſt day under the Sun, and hath no day to ſucceed it but eternity. And here we are to take notice, the thouſand years we ſpeak of are in the world to come. And in the laſt day of this world ſhall be the reſurrection of the juſt: And in the laſt day of the next world ſhall be the reſurrection of the wicked. And further we are to know, that in thoſe two places of <hi>John,</hi> (<hi>viz. John</hi> 11.24. <hi>and</hi> 6.4.) where the laſt day is ſpoken of, there is mention only of the reſurrection of the juſt, no mention

Jer. 31, 8, 9. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> I <hi>will bring them from the North country, and gather them from the coaſts of the Earth, they ſhall come with weeping, and with ſupplications will</hi> I <hi>lead them to</hi> Zion, <hi>they ſhall come, but they ſhall come with weeping and ſupplications,</hi> &amp;c.

The Scripture ſeems to ſpeak of their converſion and reduction, as if it ſhould be in an extraordinary way; Not by the preaching of the Goſpel, as the Gentile Churches were brought in unto the Lord, but by light, and by a viſible appearance of the Lord Jeſus to them.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93986:69"/>this is the appearing of the Son of man in the clouds, and the coming of the Son of man with the clouds, which (<hi>I</hi> conceive) is not to be found in Scripture, but when it denotes the coming of the Lord Jeſus at the laſt day to Judgment, whoſe appearance is viſible, and then doth he receive dominion, and glory, and a Kingdom, that all people, nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages ſhould ſerve him: And then, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (I ſpeak it with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments) will be that great converſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſo much ſpoken of in Scripture, then ſhall be fulfilled what is here ſpoken 'they 'ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, &amp;c.

To think the Saints the ſubjects of this Kingdom, if they have theſe temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſhall abuſe them to thoſe carnal pleaſures of bed and board, (which have been dreamed of by ſenſual Turks and Talmudiſts) is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaint them, and to make them vile gluttons, and unclean perſons; contrary to what the Word of God ſaith of ſuch perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do minde the things of the fleſh: But they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</hi> So alſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.

They that make this Objection, would make men believe that ſenſuality is pleaded for in this queſtion, but that is but an abuſe, both to the Aſſertors hereof, and to the queſtion it ſelf, for ſenſuality is not pleaded for, but it is indeed holineſs that they of this opinion plead for, which is ſo much by moſt exploded; yea!
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93986:72"/>derided and hated at this day in the world, who cannot abide to hear of the Saints reigning on Earth with Chriſt a thouſand years, for then would be ſuch a time, &amp; ſuch a height and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of holineſſe on earth as never was before, and never entred into the hearts of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, and this in reality is that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure, but it is a death to them to hear of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe that ſome men have dreamed, or ſhould, of carnal pleaſure, as Turks and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Talmudiſts have done; yet if we will know the minde of God in the matter, we ought to look what God aimeth at in this Kingdom, and not what ſenſual dreamers have ſaid, or aim at. Now what God aimeth at in this Kingdom, moſt evidently appears in Scripture to be a time of holineſſe and reformation, a time of peace and purity, a Kingdom of Saints and ſincere Worſhippers, who may worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, according to his own appointment, and give him the ſervice which he himſelf requires. And this is it we are to look after in the Kingdom of this queſtion, we are to think what holineſs, what righteouſneſſe, what purity, what piety, what ſincerity, what heavenly-mindedneſſe, what knowledge of God, what Orthodoxity, what pure worſhipping of God, &amp;c. ſhall be in this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93986:73"/>Kingdom, and not to talk of ſenſuality and carnal pleaſures, and ſo corrupt the point, by making a vile and wretched uſe of ſo holy and ſo religious a Kingdom, as the reign of the Saints with Chriſt on earth ſhall be. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Kingdom is moſt holy and ſacred, or elſe no Kingdom of Chriſt at all, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe becomes his Kingdom for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The reaſon why Chriſt forbids carking and caring for the things of this life, is becauſe they take off the mind from thinking on God ſo often and ſo frequently as we ſhould: And the reaſon why God will have a plenty of temporal and outward bleſſings, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ready at hand, for the uſe of all thoſe that any way ſtand in need of them, is, that the thoughts of his people, their time or ſtrength, may not be taken off from a cloſe attendance upon God, by looking after the things of this world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 31, 32.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To ſay or think that temporal bleſſings are not promiſed to the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but purely ſpiritual, is againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſse is profitable to all things, having the Bromiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> Pſal. 34, 10. <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger: but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>All theſe things ſhall be added
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93986:73"/>to you,</hi> Rev. 21.24, <hi>And the Kings of the Earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</hi> Thoſe that need theſe bleſſiags (as the Nations of them that are ſaved, and walk in the light of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> will) have the promiſe of them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To ſay that temporal bleſſings are not proper for the fruition of Saints, is to wrong the Saints of their right, for they only have a proper right from God to them, which the wicked of the world have not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Though the worſt of then may have theſe outward enjoyments for the preſent, and the beſt men want them, whereof we ſee an Example in <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet it ſhall not alwayes be ſo: for in the time of this Kingdom the beſt ſhall have them, and the worſt ſhall want them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14 17 18.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Though the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. in reſpect of its eſſentials, yet it is not without meat and drink in reſpect of additionals, as that known place doth teſtifie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Though temporal bleſſings are now but for a moment, many times; yet are they bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings while they are enjoyed; and though the grief of their ceſſation may more then counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the contentment of their fruition, to them that loſe them; yet it is very clear the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93986:74"/>Saints ſhall enjoy them in this Kingdom, during life, and ſhall not loſe them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26, 27, 28. <hi>And I will make them, and the places round about my hill, a bleſſing; and I will cauſe the ſhowre to come down in his ſeaſon; there ſhall be ſhowres of bleſſing. And the tree of the field ſhall yield her fruit, and the Earth ſhall yield her increaſe, and they ſhall be ſafe in their Land, and ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of thoſe that ſerved themſelves of them. And they ſhall no more be a prey to the Heathen, neither ſhall the Beaſts, (beaſtly men) of the Land devoure them, but they ſhall dwell ſafely, and none ſhall make them (any more) afraid,</hi> Ezek 36.28, 29, 30. <hi>I will alſo ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes, and I will call for the corne, and will increaſe it, and lay no famine upon you.

I anſwer, that when Chriſt ſhall thus gloriouſly manifeſt himſelf in perſon to the world, for his people, and againſt his enemies, and ſhall have deſtroyed the moſt part of thoſe that oppoſe him by far, at that great Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon battel; I ſay then, there ſhall and will be a mighty converſion of very many of thoſe who ſee theſe things, being ſuch wonders as men never ſaw before: Yea, and all or moſt of thoſe few that eſcape deſtruction at that great Armageddon battel, being converted, ſhall go and preach the ſtrange things of that day and time, to the Nations who are afar off, and have not ſeen and heard them; and of theſe when they ſhall have heard thoſe things, ſhall very many be converted: and theſe are the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93986:76"/>Nations of them that are ſaved: who are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and eat, and drink, and have Kings, and Ordinances, and marry, and have children, and their children are all taught of God. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be converted to God within the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, all theſe walk in the light of the New Jeruſalem, and theſe Kings bring their glory and honour to it, and take directions from it. And then when the thouſand years are ended comes the battel of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and the laſt and general Judgment, then ſounds the laſt Trumpet, (which is, as I ſaid before, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of conſummation, as the other was of the initiation of that great day) and they that are then found alive ſhall be changed as before, and Chriſt makes an end of his Kingdom, after the ſeparation, ſentence, and execution, delivering up the Kingdom to the father, that God may be all in all thenceforth for ever. This Anſwer (if I be not deceived) cuts the ham-ſtrings of this objection, if it ſelf be good; and there are but two things (I think) to be cleared to make it paſſeable,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the Rapture of the Saints,</item>
                     <item>2. That the Trumpets are ſuch, as in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication they are ſaid to be: a word therefore to theſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This Rapture of the Saints that are alive at Chriſts coming, muſt be (<hi>I</hi> think) in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the thouſand years, for they ſhall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93986:77"/>meet the Lord in the aire, which cannot be meant of the end of the thouſand years, for then Chriſt is on the Earth with them; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> firſt and then, may admit a great diſtance of time, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith in his firſt anſwer to this objection, yet I ſee not how it can do ſo here. And if (as he ſaith in his fourth Anſwer) this Rapture ſhould be to preſerve the Saints from that great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the Earth, and the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. that is alſo held to be in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the thouſand years, in the Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon battel, before the New Heavens and New Earth. And that this Rapture ſhould be without their change, and ſtating in immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>I</hi> think hardly any man will ſay, for they are thenceforth ever with the Lord on Earth, during the thouſand years, and in Heaven ever afterwards; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they neither marry, nor multiplie, nor die any more, but are as the Angels, and therefore are nore of the Nations that are ſaid to be ſaved, and walk in the light of the New <hi>Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the greateſt queſtion will be about the two Trumpets, the one of initiation or incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the thouſand years; the other of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation in the end of the thouſand years, or rather ſome time after, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9.) to wit, when <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>'s attempts are over, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93986:77"/>their armies burnt with the fire that falls from Heaven and conſumes them; for then doth the laſt Trumpet ſound. Now that this is ſo, I humbly offer what follows for the clearing of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all the dead are ſaid to be raiſed at the ſound of the Trumpet, now, as we have already heard, they are raiſed at two diſtinct different times, therefore there muſt be two diſtinct and different trumpets, for otherwiſe ſome ſhould be raiſed with the ſound of the trumpet, and the reſt without, which <hi>I</hi> think hardly any man will affirm or grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the text tells us (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52.) of a trumpet, and the laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which ſeem to be diſtinguiſhed one from another, for the laſt trumpet muſt neceſſarily be underſtood in oppoſition to a former of the ſom kind: and wheras ſome have taken this laſt trump to be the ſeventh Apocalyptick trumpet <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. and ſo called the laſt in oppoſition to the former ſix, that cannot be, becauſe thoſe are judicial trumpets, but theſe are of another kind, and have a diſtinct uſe and end from the former.</p>

And to this alſo <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to have had reſpect, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. where making mention of the day of Judgement, and perdition of unged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>One day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day.</hi> Which place <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, doth interpret of the day of Judgement. The laſt hour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or the laſt day of Chriſts ſecond coming, denotes a certain long tract of time, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitly put for the laſt time, but not for one natural day, or hour, properly ſo called, as 'tis commonly thought.

In <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20, 21, 24. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of times of refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord, &amp; the times of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken, by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He doth not point at one day in Chriſts ſecond coming but many; certainly ſo long as all things ſhall continue after they be reſtored, ſo long the day of Judgement ſhall laſt, but all things ſhall be reſtored at the day of Judgement, and continue in their being, after they are reſtored, longer then a day of twelve or twenty four hours long Surely for a man to ſay, that Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven at the day of Judgement, when all things in the world ſhall be deſtroyed, and have an end,<note place="margin">Acts 3.21. Rom 8 21.</note> is to fight againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſaith all things at his coming ſhall be reſtored, and therefore not diſſolved at that time. Or to ſay all things ſhall be reſtored at Chriſt ſecond coming and be diſſolved again by and by, is like the fancie of thoſe Heathens, who ſaid, God made other
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93986:87"/>worlds before this, but he did undo them, as ſoon as he had made them, becauſe they were not to his minde, and thus (ſay they) he ſpent his time, until he made this world that now is, which pleaſed him very well. Such a fancy they muſt needs have of God, who think all things ſhall be reſtored, at Chriſts ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſſolved again by and by. Without doubt, as when God made the world at firſt, he did not make it to deſtroy it preſently, but to continue for ſom length of time, for man to live in it to his glory, and his praiſe: ſo when God ſhall reſtore the world, at the great day of Judgement, he will not preſently diſſolve it, but have it to continue ſome length of time, that Chriſt and the Saints may reign in it, to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Again, <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaking of the ſeventh Trumpet, which is the laſt Trumpet, and the Trumpet (I mean of the judicial Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets) of conſummation, and ſo the Trumpet of Chriſts ſecond coming, he attributes many days to it.

Pliny</hi> tells us, that the life of an <hi>Oak</hi> is nine hundred years, more or leſs, which comes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near <hi>Johns</hi> thouſand years. The words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> are the wood of life, but the <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint</hi> renders it the tree of life, with which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agrees the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraft. In which words ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> we may underſtand the thouſand years to be ſecretly pointed at. It was the conceit of the ſame <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> (and not altogether to be ſlighted) that the life of the tree of life, or of man in the ſtate of Paradice, was to conſiſt of a thouſand years that is to ſay, that ſo long, man had he not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93986:88"/>ſhould have lived in this world, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have been tranſlated into a more happy both place and condition. But <hi>Adam</hi> having ſinned, by eating the forbidden fruit, therefore neither himſelf, nor any of his poſterity (though ſome of them very long lived) ſhould attain to that number of years, but ſhould die before they had any of them lived out ſo great a day. But when all things ſhall be reſtored, that long liv'd day ſhall be reſtored to the ſons of the firſt reſurrection, and they ſhall live one thouſand years. So the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſpeaking of the day of Chriſts ſecond coming, <hi>chap</hi> 14.9. ſaith, <hi>the Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth, and in that day there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one.</hi> And adds ver. 16. <hi>they ſhall go up from year to year, to worſhip the King the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> which is an alluſion to thoſe old Jewiſh rites, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens onely their ſerving God; of which ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15. Where thoſe Palm bearing triumphers are ſaid to ſerve God day and night in his Temple. Laſtly, Chriſt tells us of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain world to come, in which ſins may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. not to the ſons of the reſurrection, who are without all ſin; but to thoſe who are of the Nations that are ſaved, and walk in the light of the New <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21.24.) who yet ſinning, and repenting of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93986:89"/>their ſins, obtain remiſſion in Chriſts blood.</p>
               <p>And now (good Reader) hark a little to the peculiar priviledges of that day and time, yet for brevitys ſake, take them almoſt in ſo many words.</p>
               <p>¶ I In the time of this thouſand years there will be an end for ever of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet.

Farewell thou Whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Rev.</hi> 18.3. who didſt inebriate the Nations, and their Kings, with the wine of the wrath of thy fornications. Thy judgements are come in a day (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8.) death, and mourning and famine, for ſtrong is the Lord God that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee. Rejoyce (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.20) over her thou heaven (Church) and ye holy Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for God hath avenged you at her hand. That wicked horn (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21) is broken off, who warred againſt, and wore out the Saints; the multitude of thy offences, now at laſt, hath broken the multitude of thy forces, and thou canſt not call back the day that is paſt. Thy two horns indeed made the world to take thee for a Lamb, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.) but thy ſpeech againſt the Saints was alwaies like a Dragon. Therefore full well art thou caſt into (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.) the Lake of fire; for ever, as thine own dung, to periſh, though thy branches ſhot up to Heaven,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93986:89"/>and thy roots down as low as Hell; yet the Saints now do reign, and rejoyce in thy ruine.</p>

Then (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6.) ſhall the Lord God Omnipotent reign, with the ſhoutings and Hallelujahs of his Elect. Yea! the Saints ſhall ſit on Thrones, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.22.27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28.) and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93986:90"/>judge the World. This well may ſtain the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dazel the glory of all Earthly powers. For then (<hi>Iſa</hi> 24.23.) the Moon ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the Sun aſhamed, when the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reign in Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and before his Ancients gloriouſly.

Moreover then will be a laſting peace, and wars ſhall ceaſe to the ends of the Earth, when Chriſt the Prince of peace ſhall ſway the Scepter, judging amongſt many Nations, and rebuking many people. Then ſhall their ſwords be beaten into plow-ſhares, and their Speares into pruning books, Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, nor ſhall they learn war any more, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.4. In that day, ſaith God, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18.) I will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battle ax out of the Earth, and I will make them to lye down ſafely.

               <p n="5">V. Alſo then will all perſecution be brought to an end and ceaſe. Then the envy of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall depart, and the Adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be cut off, <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall not envy <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall not envy <hi>Ephraim, Iſa.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Ezek</hi> 28.24. And there ſhall be no more a pricking Bryer unto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor

See alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.25. <hi>and</hi> 26. then Chriſt weeds out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.

               <p n="6">VI. Then likewiſe will be an and of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. For who is left to oppreſs, the Beaſt and falſe prophet they are gone, the Dragon is bound, all wicked men are now under the Hatches, and laid at Chriſts foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool.
